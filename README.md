## This is frontend done in Angular 1.5
- backend for this projec is here  bachttps://github.com/gsokolowski/laravel-gallery
- please clone backend first and import data again as I've updated data factory in backend project

## Frontend does
- shows list of active images
- shows list of deleted images
- allows to delete image
- allows to restore deleted image
- allows to download image

## Pull backend first otherwise frontend will not work

## Frontend will look for virtual host http://laravel-gallery.local so you need to configure you backend first
