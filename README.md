## This is front end implemented in Angular 1.5
- back end for this project is here https://github.com/gsokolowski/laravel-gallery
- please clone backend first and import data again as I've updated data factory in backend project

## Front end allwes user to:
- see list of active images
- see list of deleted images
- delete image
- restore deleted image
- download image

## Pull back end first otherwise front end will not work

- front end will look for virtual host http://laravel-gallery.local so you need to configure you backend first
