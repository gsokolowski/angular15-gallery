<!-- myApp i a name of module and any angular application needs to be defined as module

<!--
- Single Page Application, url is changing application is not refreshing, what changes is part of application
If user goes to particular route, then HTML page will be loaded in to the application and that part will be displayed
In angularJs Single Page Applications are used through roots

- Route maps to url path and also specify controller and template for that url and when url changes in the browser,
the angular is going to change the controller and view template that is using is going to display that to you

- Templates

First step is to add angular-route.min.js to script in this index and also add ngRoute dependency to module app.js

    <!-- angular js works with templates and this is the place where template views will be loaded
    through directive ng-view-->



        <!--ng-view needed by router
            Your application needs a container to put the content provided by the routing.
            This container is the ng-view directive.
            There are three different ways to include the ng-view directive in your application:-->


    <div ng-view id="content"></div>


    <div id="background"></div>
